# Nought

Classy implementation of noughts and crosses, as an example of refactoring functional code into object oriented code.

### Usage
Run main.py 

### TODO
* Add better AI algorithms (currently just randomly picks a ile)
* Add a gui using TKinter or similar
* Fully support n-sized board
* Support winning with n tiles in a row (currently requires a full row/col/diagonal)
